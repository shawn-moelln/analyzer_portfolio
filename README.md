# adminlte-rails-hub

lightweight command runner for repetitive tasks

## why this exists

i needed something that just works without reading 50 pages of docs.

## install

```bash
npm i adminlte-rails-hub
```

## use it

```js
import tool from 'adminlte-rails-hub'
tool({ input: 'data.json' })
```

## tech

runs on standups, probably buggy

## limitations

- not optimized yet
- not production ready

created out of frustration
